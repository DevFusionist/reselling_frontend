# Velvet Zenith — Next.js Starter

This is a minimal scaffold generated for the Velvet Zenith luxury hybrid e-commerce project.
It includes basic pages, components, and Tailwind configuration following Theme 2.

To run locally:

1. Install node (v18+) and pnpm/npm/yarn
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

This package is intentionally minimal — expand components, add API routes, and connect your commerce backend.
